### Description:  

This course builds on the foundation provided by the programming fundamentals/object-oriented programming sequence to introduce the fundamental concepts of data structures and the algorithms that proceed from them. Topics include recursion, the underlying philosophy of object-oriented programming, fundamental data structures (including stacks, queues, linked lists, hash tables, trees, and graphs), the basics of algorithmic analysis, and an introduction to the principles of language translation.

### Lecture:

TR 1:00 PM - 2:50 PM (SCI-226)

### Textbook: 

Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, Edition: 4, Adam Drozdek. ISBN:9781133608424 (It's also available from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Adam-Drozdek-ebook/dp/B00B6F0F5S/)). The textbook is required.

### Student Learning Outcomes:

**CSLO1** - Analyze problems and select the appropriate data structure.

**CSLO2** - Estimate running time given an algorithm.

**CSLO3** - Implement and use linear data structures including sets, stacks, queues, and lists.

**CSLO4** - Implement and use trees including binary trees, binary search trees, and heaps.

### Grading:

Grades for the current semester are available on Canvas. At the end of the semester, the total number of points awarded is added up and grades are given on the basis of the percentage of that total. The grade basis is:

#### Grade
Minimum Percentage

| Grade|     | Percent |
|-----:|:---:|--------:|
| A    |  ≥  |     88% |
| B    |  ≥  |     78% |
| C    |  ≥  |     68% |
| D    |  ≥  |     58% |
| F    |  <  |     58% |


#### Grade Breakdown

Your grade is based on how you do on programming assignments, participation, and the mid-term & final examinations. Each of these items are weighted when calculating your final grade. The following table gives these weights:

|Type                             |Weight|
|:--------------------------------|-----:|
| Participation                   |  10% |
| Quizzes                         |  10% |
| Programming Assignments & Labs  |  30% |
| Mid-term Examination            |  20% |
| Final Examination               |  30% |
|**Total**                        | **100%** | 

#### Notes:

- I use 88% rather than 90% so I can give a higher grade to those students who are close. This means that if you are at 87.99% you are not close to an "A".

- This class is exam, quiz, and programming assignment oriented. You must successfully complete all of the exams, quizzes and programming assignments in order to get the maximum out of this class.

- Programming assignments are turned in when they are submitted using GitHub. No credit will be given for any other method of submission unless explicitly requested to do so.

- Assignments with due dates on the Sunday following the last day of instruction cannot be turned in late.

The midterm and the final exam will be given on the dates announced on the web pages.
Quizzes have a an hour time limit and are for the express purpose of making sure that you are keeping up on your reading. Quizzes can be taken twice (with a half an hour between attempts) but are due on the time and date specified and cannot be completed late.

#### Late Assignments:

To get the most out of the class all assignments should be turned in before the time shown for each individual assignment. Do not make assumptions about when items are due! However, some items are accepted late using the procedure detailed below.

Programming Assignments  
- Can be turned in late.

Quizzes  
- **Cannot** be completed late.

Midterm  
- **Cannot** be turned in late, unless prior arrangements are made at least 1 week in advance.

Final  
- **Cannot** be turned in late, unless prior arrangements are made at least 2 weeks in advance.

#### Procedure for late assignments

Each assignment has a point value, for example, 6 points. Students may turn in assignments late and have deducted one point for each 24 hour period the assignment is turned in after the due date (all times for due dates are Pacific Time). For example, the 6 point assignment turned in one second (or any measurable fraction of time) after the due date and time will have one point deducted from it. As each 24 hour period expires, another point will be deducted. As soon as the point value is zero, the assignment can no longer be turned in. That means the 6 point assignment cannot be turned in after six 24 hour periods has passed. This concept is very important when applying extra credit. 

For the purposes of deciding when an assignment is completed, I will take the time of the commit in GitHub, not when the tests are run on the Jenkins CI server.

For those assignments that are turned in late but before the final cut off, you can apply extra credit points you earn through out the term to make up for these lost points. Again, see the section on Extra Credit for further details.

Please read carefully the next section, regarding Extra Credit, for further details.

#### Extra Credit

To allow students to be as successful as possible, there will be several opportunities to earn extra credit throughout the term. These points can then be applied to lost credit on assignments (whether late or not), and then to exams, in that order. No extra credit points will be applied to participation.

The following descriptions detail the different types of extra credit that will be given throughout the term.

1. _Extra Credit Assignments_: I will post near the beginning of the quarter at least two extra credit assignments where students can earn up to 5 points for each assignment by writing about specific historical events in computing. These events will be chosen by me, and posted to the Moodle site. Their due date will be at the end of the term.

3. _Make Allan Cooler_: On Slack there is a channel specifically named "Make Allan Cooler" participation in this channel with colloquilisms and contempory song suggestions will earn students extra credit points, determined at the end of the term.

3. _VC CS Club Events_: Throughout the term the CS Club will be putting on talks from people in industry and academia. You can earn extra credit points for attending these events. Students must sign the attendance sheet at the talk to earn the extra credit points. I will post on the Moodle site which events qualify for extra credit.

### Accommodations

Students with disabilities, who may need accommodations in this class, are encouraged to
contact the EAC as soon as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a
timely manner. Authorization, based on verification of disability, is required before any
accommodation can be provided. The EAC can be contacted by telephone at 805-289-6300 or
can be visited at the EAC office in the Administration Building on campus.
